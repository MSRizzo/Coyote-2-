  <h1>Coyotes</h1>
  <body>
    <p>The coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) is a species of canine native to North America. It is smaller than its close relative, the gray wolf, and slightly smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf. 
        It fills much of the same ecological niche as the golden jackal does in Eurasia, though it is larger and more predatory and is sometimes called the American jackal by zoologists. 
        Other names for the species, largely historical, include the prairie wolf and the brush wolf.</p>
    <p>The coyote is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, due to its wide distribution and abundance throughout North America, southwards through Mexico and into Central America.
        The species is versatile, able to adapt to and expand into environments modified by humans. It is enlarging its range, with coyotes moving into urban areas in the eastern U.S., and was sighted in eastern Panama (across the Panama Canal from their home range) for the first time in 2013. The coyote has 19 recognized subspecies. The average male weighs 8 to 20 kg (18 to 44 lb) and the average female 7 to 18 kg (15 to 40 lb). Their fur color is predominantly light gray and red or fulvous interspersed with black and white, though it varies somewhat with geography. 
        It is highly flexible in social organization, living either in a family unit or in loosely knit packs of unrelated individuals. Primarily carnivorous, its diet consists mainly of deer, rabbits, hares, rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates, though it may also eat fruits and vegetables on occasion. 
        Its characteristic vocalization is a howl made by solitary individuals. Humans are the coyote's greatest threat, followed by cougars and gray wolves. In spite of this, coyotes sometimes mate with gray, eastern, or red wolves, producing "coywolf" hybrids. 
        In the northeastern regions of North America, the eastern coyote (a larger subspecies, though still smaller than wolves) is the result of various historical and recent matings with various types of wolves. Genetic studies show that most North American wolves contain some level of coyote DNA.
        The coyote is a prominent character in Native American folklore, mainly in Aridoamerica, usually depicted as a trickster that alternately assumes the form of an actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions.
        The animal was especially respected in Mesoamerican cosmology as a symbol of military might. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was seen in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. 
        Unlike wolves (gray, eastern, or red), which have undergone an improvement of their public image, attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.</p>

  <h1>History</h1>
  <body>
    <p>  At the time of the European colonization of the Americas, coyotes were largely confined to open plains and arid regions of the western half of the continent. 
        In early post-Columbian historical records, distinguishing between coyotes and wolves is often difficult. 
        One record from 1750 in Kaskaskia, Illinois, written by a local priest, noted that the "wolves" encountered there were smaller and less daring than European wolves. 
        Another account from the early 1800s in Edwards County mentioned wolves howling at night, though these were likely coyotes.
        This species was encountered several times during the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804â€“1806), though it was already well known to European traders on the upper Missouri. 
        Lewis, writing on 5 May 1805, in northeastern Montana, described the coyote in these terms:
        The small wolf or burrowing dog of the prairies are the inhabitants almost invariably of the open plains; 
        they usually associate in bands of ten or twelve sometimes more and burrow near some pass or place much frequented by game; 
        not being able alone to take deer or goat they are rarely ever found alone but hunt in bands; they frequently watch and seize their prey near their burrows; 
        in these burrows they raise their young and to them they also resort when pursued; when a person approaches them they frequently bark, 
        their note being precisely that of the small dog. They are of an intermediate size between that of the fox and dog, very active fleet and delicately formed;
        the ears large erect and pointed the head long and pointed more like that of the fox; tale long ... the hair and fur also resembles the fox, tho' is much coarser and inferior.
        They are of a pale redish-brown colour. The eye of a deep sea green colour small and piercing. Their [claws] are reather longer than those of the ordinary wolf or that common to the Atlantic states, none of which are to be found in this quarter, nor I believe above the river Plat.
        The coyote was first scientifically described by naturalist Thomas Say in September 1819, on the site of Lewis and Clark's Council Bluffs, 24 km (15 mi) up the Missouri River from the mouth of the Platte during a government-sponsored expedition with Major Stephen Long. 
        He had the first edition of the Lewis and Clark journals in hand, which contained Biddle's edited version of Lewis's observations dated 5 May 1805.
        His account was published in 1823. Say was the first person to document the difference between a "prairie wolf" (coyote) and on the next page of his journal a wolf which he named Canis nubilus (Great Plains wolf).[3][18] Say described the coyote as:[</p>
