  <h1>History</h1>
  <body>
    <p>  At the time of the European colonization of the Americas, coyotes were largely confined to open plains and arid regions of the western half of the continent. 
        In early post-Columbian historical records, distinguishing between coyotes and wolves is often difficult. 
        One record from 1750 in Kaskaskia, Illinois, written by a local priest, noted that the "wolves" encountered there were smaller and less daring than European wolves. 
        Another account from the early 1800s in Edwards County mentioned wolves howling at night, though these were likely coyotes.
        This species was encountered several times during the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804â€“1806), though it was already well known to European traders on the upper Missouri. 
        Lewis, writing on 5 May 1805, in northeastern Montana, described the coyote in these terms:
        The small wolf or burrowing dog of the prairies are the inhabitants almost invariably of the open plains; 
        they usually associate in bands of ten or twelve sometimes more and burrow near some pass or place much frequented by game; 
        not being able alone to take deer or goat they are rarely ever found alone but hunt in bands; they frequently watch and seize their prey near their burrows; 
        in these burrows they raise their young and to them they also resort when pursued; when a person approaches them they frequently bark, 
        their note being precisely that of the small dog. They are of an intermediate size between that of the fox and dog, very active fleet and delicately formed;
        the ears large erect and pointed the head long and pointed more like that of the fox; tale long ... the hair and fur also resembles the fox, tho' is much coarser and inferior.
        They are of a pale redish-brown colour. The eye of a deep sea green colour small and piercing. Their [claws] are reather longer than those of the ordinary wolf or that common to the Atlantic states, none of which are to be found in this quarter, nor I believe above the river Plat.
        The coyote was first scientifically described by naturalist Thomas Say in September 1819, on the site of Lewis and Clark's Council Bluffs, 24 km (15 mi) up the Missouri River from the mouth of the Platte during a government-sponsored expedition with Major Stephen Long. 
        He had the first edition of the Lewis and Clark journals in hand, which contained Biddle's edited version of Lewis's observations dated 5 May 1805.
        His account was published in 1823. Say was the first person to document the difference between a "prairie wolf" (coyote) and on the next page of his journal a wolf which he named Canis nubilus (Great Plains wolf).[3][18] Say described the coyote as:[</p>
